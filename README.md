# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

A console-based C++ project that demonstrates core data structures through fun, themed mini-systems.

## ðŸ“‹ Main Menu
=== Data Structure and Algorithms Main Menu ===
1. NBA Card Collection (Doubly Linked List)
2. Browser History (Stack)
3. Coffee Ordering System (Queue)
4. Corleone Family Tree (Tree)
5. Student Directory (Hash Table)
6. Ancestral Breathing Techniques (Graph)
7. Exit

Each option in the menu showcases a key data structure implemented in C++, applied to a creative, relatable example.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- **Doubly Linked List:** Manage and traverse an NBA card collection.
- **Stack:** Simulate browser backtracking behavior.
- **Queue:** Model a coffee shop's order line.
- **Tree:** Represent and navigate a fictional family tree.
- **Hash Table:** Store and retrieve student data efficiently.
- **Graph:** Explore relationships using a custom traversal (e.g., "Ancestral Breathing Techniques").

## ðŸ›  Tech Used
- **C++ (Standard Library)**
- Console I/O
- Basic OOP principles
